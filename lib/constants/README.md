# Constants Folder

## Overview

The Constants Folder is an integral part of our application's structure, designated for storing constant values that are used across different parts of the app. This folder helps in maintaining a central repository of all constant data, ensuring consistency and ease of management.

## Folder Structure

- **constants/**
  - `app_colors.dart`
  - `app_dimensions.dart`
  - `app_strings.dart`
  - ...

The Constants Folder contains Dart files, each categorized by the type of constants they hold, such as colors, dimensions, strings, and other commonly used constant values.

## Guidelines for Using the Constants Folder

1. **Centralized Constants:** Use this folder to define constants that are used in multiple places within the application. This includes UI-related constants (like colors, padding, margins) and non-UI constants (like API URLs, default values).

2. **Categorization:** Organize constants into files based on their type or usage. For example, all color constants can be placed in an `app_colors.dart` file.

3. **Consistent Naming Convention:** Adopt a consistent naming convention for constants to make them easily identifiable and understandable. For example, use uppercase with underscores for constant names (e.g., `DEFAULT_PADDING`).

4. **Avoiding Magic Numbers and Strings:** Use the Constants Folder to avoid magic numbers and strings in the code. Define such values as constants here to increase code readability and maintainability.

5. **Documentation:** Provide comments and documentation for constants, especially if their purpose or value is not immediately clear. This helps in understanding the context and usage of these constants.

## Example

In `app_colors.dart`, define the color palette for the application, like primary and secondary colors, text colors, etc. Then, these colors can be consistently used throughout the app's UI, ensuring a cohesive design.

## Advantages of Using the Constants Folder

- **Consistency:** Promotes consistency in the use of constant values throughout the app.
- **Maintainability:** Simplifies updating and managing constants, as they are all located in one place.
- **Readability:** Enhances code readability by replacing hard-coded values with descriptive constant names.
