# Features Folder

## Overview

The Features Folder in our app's structure is designed to organize and manage components that are specific to individual pages of the application. This approach helps in maintaining a clear and modular structure, making it easier to navigate and understand the codebase.

## Folder Structure

- **Features/**
  - **[page_name_1]/**
    - `component_1.dart`
    - `component_2.dart`
  - **[page_name_2]/**
    - `component_3.dart`
    - `component_4.dart`
  - ...

Each page in the application that uses unique components should have a corresponding subfolder within the Features folder. The name of the subfolder should match the name of the page it represents.

## Guidelines for Using the Features Folder

1. **Page-Specific Components:** The components placed in this folder should be specific to a single page. These are not shared across different parts of the application.

2. **Subfolder Naming Convention:** Create a subfolder for each page with the same name as the page. For example, if you have a page called `Cart`, create a subfolder named `Cart` within the Features folder.

3. **Component Placement:** Place all components that are specific to a page inside its respective subfolder. This ensures that all related components are grouped together.

4. **Accepting Models as Parameters:** Since components in this folder are used in a single context, it is acceptable for these components to accept entire models as parameters. This allows for direct access to individual data fields within the model. For instance, a component named `CustomCartDisplay` could accept a list of `CartItem` objects (`List<CartItem> cartItems`) and be specifically used for displaying cart items.

5. **Isolation of Page-Specific Logic:** Keep page-specific logic and functionality within these components. This isolation simplifies the maintenance and scalability of the application.

## Example

In this shopping app with a potential page named `Cart`. The Features folder would include a subfolder named `Cart`, containing components such as `CustomCartDisplay`, `CartItem`, `CartTotal`, etc., each handling specific aspects of the cart page.

## Advantages of Using the Features Folder

- **Modularity:** Helps in maintaining a clean and modular codebase.
- **Scalability:** Eases the process of scaling the application by adding new pages and their corresponding components.
- **Maintainability:** Simplifies code maintenance by isolating page-specific logic and components.
