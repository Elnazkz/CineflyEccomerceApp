# `lib` Folder Overview

## Introduction

The `lib` folder currently contains the default Flutter example project, which demonstrates basic Flutter concepts, including state management and UI building. The example features a simple counter application where clicking a button updates the state. You can use this to test your development environment is working correctly

## Structure of the Example Project

- **main.dart**: This is the entry point of the Flutter application. It includes the main `MyApp` widget and the `MyHomePage` widget, which contains the logic for the counter and the button to increment the counter.

## Starting Your Project

To begin working on your own project, you will need to modify the contents of the `lib` folder:

1. **Clear Existing Code:** Remove the code related to the default Flutter example, specifically the counter logic in the `MyHomePage` widget.

2. **Create Your Pages:** Start adding your own pages by creating new Dart files in the `lib` folder. Refer to the [Pages Folder](../lib/pages/README.md) documentation for guidelines on structuring full-page components.

3. **Use the Features Folder:** Utilize the [Features Folder](../lib/features/README.md) for adding components specific to individual pages.

4. **Add Reusable Widgets:** For reusable UI components, refer to the [Widgets Folder](../lib/widgets/README.md) and add your widgets accordingly.

5. **Implement Utilities and Constants:** Use the [Utilities Folder](../lib/utilities/README.md) and [Constants Folder](../lib/constants/README.md) for shared functionalities and constant values, respectively.
