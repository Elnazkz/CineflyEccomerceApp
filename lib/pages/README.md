# Pages Folder

## Overview

The Pages Folder is a key part of our app's structure, designed to hold the full-page components of the application. The primary objective with the pages is to keep them as simple and readable as possible, focusing on high-level organization and structure.

## Folder Structure

- **pages/**
  - `home_page.dart`
  - `settings_page.dart`
  - `profile_page.dart`
  - ...

The Pages Folder contains Dart files, each representing a full page in the app. The naming convention follows the Dart standard of snake case (e.g., `home_page.dart` for the home page).

## Guidelines for Using the Pages Folder

1. **Simplicity of Pages:** Strive to make each page as simple as possible. A clean and straightforward page structure improves readability and maintainability.

2. **Use of Top-Level Components:** Build pages using top-level components that are sourced from the Features and Widgets folders. This practice helps in abstracting the complex functionalities and keeping the page code clean.

3. **Naming Convention:** Follow the Dart-specific naming convention of using snake case for file names. For example, use `cart_page.dart` for a page related to the shopping cart.

4. **Focus on Page Structure:** Each page file should primarily focus on the layout and structure of the page, delegating detailed functionalities and UI elements to components from the Features and Widgets folders.

5. **Organized Code:** Organize the code within each page to enhance clarity. Use comments and proper code structuring to make it easily understandable.

## Example

Consider an e-commerce app with several pages like Home, Cart, and Profile. The Pages Folder would contain files like `home_page.dart`, `cart_page.dart`, and `profile_page.dart`. Each of these files would construct the page using components from Features and Widgets, such as `NavigationBar`, `ProductList`, `CartSummary`, etc.

## Advantages of Using the Pages Folder

- **Clarity:** Keeps the full-page components separate and easily identifiable.
- **Ease of Navigation:** Simplifies navigation and understanding of the app's structure, especially for new developers.
- **Modular Design:** Promotes a modular and scalable design by separating page structure from component logic.
