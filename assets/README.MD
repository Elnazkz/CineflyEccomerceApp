# `assets` Folder Overview

## Introduction

The `assets` folder in this Flutter project is designated for storing all the static assets used in the application. These assets typically include images, fonts, and other files such as JSON or configuration files.

## Structure of the Assets Folder

- **images/**: Contains image files (e.g., .png, .jpg, .gif).
- **fonts/**: Contains font files (e.g., .ttf, .otf).
- **data/**: (Optional) For data files like JSON or XML.
- **icons/**: (Optional) For icon files.

## Adding and Using Assets

### Adding Assets

1. **Place Assets:** Add your assets (images, fonts, etc.) to the appropriate subfolders within the `assets` folder.

2. **Declare in pubspec.yaml:** Declare the assets in the `pubspec.yaml` file to make them available in your app. For example:

```yaml
flutter:
  assets:
    - assets/images/
    - assets/fonts/
